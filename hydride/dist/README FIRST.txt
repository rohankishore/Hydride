Hey! 

Thank you for taking the time to test Hydride. This is the first BETA of the app. Right now, it contains 2024 and 2023 PYQ of KEAM Units and Dimensions only as a test. 

Since this's a beta, there's high chances that you meet with any bugs/glitches. Kindly report it to me so that i can fix it in the next BETA. 

I'm actively adding more and more questions. 

Once again, thanks A LOT!!
